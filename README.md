Fraud App Detection
We built a solution where we check all the apps in the app store that appear to be fraudulent or fake versions of original apps. we checked the details of the app and what permissions its asking for ,the domain of operations, also matched the app icon and description. We also scrapped information of some chinese apps using the apk file to judge if they are fraud or not
